            <h4>Early Life and Struggles</h4>
            <p>
              <span data-aos="zoom-in">Narendra Damodardas Modi</span>was born
              on September 17, 1950, in Vadnagar, a small town in Gujarat.
              Coming from a modest background, he helped his father sell tea at
              a railway station during his childhood. Despite financial
              hardships, his determination for self-growth was evident from a
              young age. His early years were marked by spiritual exploration—he
              traveled across India, visiting ashrams and learning about
              different cultures, which played a significant role in shaping his
              ideology.
